The main objective of this study was to observe the demographics of obesity in the United States. Obesity remains an important issue because almost half of the worldâ€™s adult population could be overweight or obese by 2030 according to The Global Obesity Threat published by McKinsey&Company. Obesity is often related to health conditions such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancer in addition to contributing to economic and productivity costs.

My main goal was to identify distinct segments with high obesity within the US population. Market segmentation could allow for more effective targeting of products and marketing campaign such as promotion of gym memberships, healthy eating programs, or healthcare discounts in order to move Americans towards healthier weights.
